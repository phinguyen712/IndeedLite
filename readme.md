## Getting Started
If you don't have webpack installed yet, you can run the command below:
```bash
npm install webpack -g
```


When building the project for the very first time, run the following command.
```bash
npm install
```

This will install all of your node modules.

## Running
To run the project, simply run the following command
```bash
webpack -w
```
```bash
npm start
```

Everything should be available on localhost:3000
